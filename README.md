# Directional-Derivatives-mini-project
The idea behind this project is to give a certain point P(x,y) and a vector U <u1,u2> directing this point and this program will calulate the 
Directional Derivates & Gradients

Our function is  F(x,y) = x³y - xy³

Our Gradients are  ∇F(x,y)= <∂F(x,y)\∂x, ∂F(x,y)\∂y> = < 3x²y - y³, x³ - 3xy² > - in this case we can call it. G 

The vector Un is the normalized version of U 

The Directional derviative is the dot product of the gradient and the normalized vector : G dot Un

Our Directional Derivative is DF(x,y)= ∇F(x,y).Un
