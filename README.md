# Directional-Derivatives-mini-project
The idea behind this project is to give a certain point X and a vector U directing this point and this function will calulate the 
Directional Derivates & Gradients

Our function is  F(x,y) = x³y - xy³

Our Gradients are  ∇F(x,y)= <∂F(x,y)\∂x, ∂F(x,y)\∂y> = < 3x²y - y³, x³ - 3xy² >

Our Directional Derivative is DF(x,y)= ∇F(x,y).Un
